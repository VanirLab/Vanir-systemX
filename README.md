# Vanir-systemX
## Advanced security autmation for industry and embedded systems

## GuideLine
 An essential function of the Vanir ICS is to provide details of the physical mission system so
that the health of that system can be assessed and appropriate control actions can be
chosen and executed as needed. Unfortunately, complex ICS are themselves susceptible
to failures and malicious cyber and physical attacks. A failed or compromised ICS cannot be utilized to construct an accurate representation of the mission system or to ensure that chosen controls are faithfully executed by that system. 


## Missions with the Vanir systemX

- [x] To reduce the exposure of the Vanir ICS to the other networks.
- [x] Use standards, formally verified software where possible.
- [x] Maintain a tight control on access points to the Vanir ICS.
- [x] Human team should be able to integrate historical data (including successful attacks)
and trends, information from outside sources, and real-time data. 

- [x] Independent sensors should be used to help the human team resolve inconsistencies 
and address malicious distortion of sensor data.
